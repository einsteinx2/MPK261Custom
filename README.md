# Ableton Remote Script - MPK261Custom

This script adds a number of Ableton control functions for the Akai MPK261.
Ableton is a fantastic software suite, and the Akai MP261 is an excellent keyboard.
But the default MPK261 control in Ableton is lacking - it could do so much more!

## MPK261 Pre-Setup

To use effectively, a few defaults need to be changed in the MPK261 configuration.

### MPK261 Configuration Changes Required

This is based on the LiveLite default preset. Recommend creating a copy of this preset and editing that in the MPK261 config.

- Edit the Pads in banks B, C, and D Note Mode to use Toggle instead of Momentary.
  Momentary turns on the button while it is pressed and turns it off when it is released.
  Toggle turns the button on when pressed, then turns the button off when it is pressed a second time. To edit:
    1. Click the Edit button on the MPK261
    2. Click the correct bank (to the left of the Pads), then touch the Pad. The MPK261 display should show "Pad#" at the top.
    3. Click the right arrow 2 times to go to Pg3. The MPK261 display should show "Node Mode".
    4. Turn the knob above the arrow buttons to select "Toggle".
    5. Repeat for all the pads on banks B, C, and D. Touch the pad.
- Edit the S1-S8 buttons for Control Banks B & C to use Toggle instead of Momentary.
    1. Click the Edit button on the MPK261
    2. Click the correct control bank (under the Stop and Play buttons), then touch the S button (example: S1). The MPK261 display should show "Switch#" at the top. Bank 2 switch 1 = Switch09, etc.
    3. Click the right arrow and down to go to Mode.
    4. Turn the knob above the arrow buttons to select "Toggle" from "Momentary".
    5. Repeat for all the switch buttons in control banks B & C.
- Edit the K1-K8 knobs for Control Bank B to use Relative instead of Absolute.
    1. Click the Edit button on the MPK261
    2. Click control bank B (under the Stop and Play buttons), then turn the K knob (example: K1). The MPK261 display should show "Knob#" at the top. Bank 2 knob 1 = Knob09, etc.
    3. Turn the knob above the arrow buttons to select "INC/DEC2" from "MIDI CC".
    4. Repeat for all of the knobs in control bank B.

## Installation

1. Use the Ableton installation instructions for [Installing third-party remote scripts](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209072009-Installing-third-party-remote-scripts) which provides the directories and the general process.
2. Download the python files into a new directory, "MPK261Custom" under your "User Library" folder
   while Ableton is stopped. You may have to create the "User Library" directory.
   See the step above for how to do that and where it goes.
3. Start Ableton.  THe first time Ableton runs - and any time there is a change to a py file - it will compile the .py files into .pyc.
4. Under the preferences->Midi, choose MPK261Custom in the Control Surface.

## Troubleshooting

On the Mac, Ableton writes logs to:
/Users/{username}/Library/Preferences/Ableton/Live {version}/Log.txt

Python errors & other issues will be reported there.

## MPK261 Mappings

For reference, here are the MPK261 MIDI button / CC mappings used in the MPK261 preset "LiveLite" and is what this is based on.
